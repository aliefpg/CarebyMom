        <item>\t\t\tGaining an appropriate amount of weight during pregnancy helps your baby grow to a healthy size. But gaining too much or too little weight may lead to serious health problems for you and your baby.\n\n\t\t\tAccording to experts, gaining too much weight during pregnancy raises your chances for developing gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) and high blood pressure during pregnancy. It also increases your risk for type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure later in life. If you’re overweight or have obesity when you get pregnant, your chances for health problems may be even higher. You could also be more likely to have a cesarean section (C-section).\n\n\t\t\tGaining a healthy amount of weight helps you have an easier pregnancy and delivery. It may also help make it easier for you to get back to a healthy weight after delivery. Research shows that recommended amounts of weight gain during pregnancy can also lower the chances that you or your child will have obesity and weight-related problems later in life.</item>
        <item>\t\t\tConsuming healthy foods and low-calorie beverages, particularly water, and the appropriate number of calories may help you and your baby gain the proper amount of weight.\n\n\t\t\tHow much food and how many calories you need depends on things such as your weight before pregnancy, your age, and how quickly you gain weight. If you’re at a healthy weight, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says you need no extra calories in your first trimester, about 340 extra calories a day in your second trimester, and about 450 extra calories a day in your third trimester.1 You also may not need extra calories during the final weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\t\t\tCheck with your health care professional about your weight gain. If you’re not gaining the weight you need, he or she may advise you to take in more calories. If you’re gaining too much weight, you may need to cut down on calories. Each woman’s needs are different. Your needs also depend on whether you were underweight, overweight, or had obesity before you became pregnant, or if you’re having more than one baby.</item>
        <item>\t\t\tA vegetarian eating plan during pregnancy can be healthy. Consider the quality of your eating plan and talk to your health care professional to make sure you’re getting enough calcium, iron, protein, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and other needed nutrients. Your health care professional may also tell you to take vitamins and minerals that will help you meet your needs.</item>
        <item>\t\t\tYes. During pregnancy, you need more vitamins and minerals such as folate, iron, and calcium.\n\n\t\t\tGetting the appropriate amount of folate is very important. Folate, a B vitamin also known as folic acid, may help prevent birth defects. Before pregnancy, you need 400 mcg per day from supplements or fortified foods, in addition to the folate you get naturally from foods and beverages. During pregnancy, you need 600 mcg. While breastfeeding, you need 500 mcg of folate per day.Foods high in folate include orange juice, strawberries, spinach, broccoli, beans, fortified breads, and fortified low-sugar breakfast cereals. These foods may even provide 100% of the daily value of folic acid per serving.\n\n\t\t\tMost health care professionals tell women who are pregnant to take a prenatal vitamin every day and consume healthy foods, snacks, and beverages. Ask your doctor about what you should take.</item>
        <item>\t\t\tMost women need the same amount of physical activity as they did before becoming pregnant. Aim for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Aerobic activities—also called endurance or cardio activities—use large muscle groups (back, chest, and legs) to increase your heart rate and breathing. Brisk walking is a form of aerobic activity.\n\n\t\t\tHow can you tell if you’re doing moderate-intensity aerobic activity? Take the “talk test” to find out. If you’re breathing hard but can still have a conversation easily—but you can’t sing—that’s moderate intensity.\n\n\t\t\tIf you can only say a few words before pausing for a breath, that’s called vigorous-intensity activity. If you were in the habit of doing vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or were physically active before your pregnancy, then it’s likely okay for you to continue these activities during your pregnancy.\n\n\t\t\tYou can talk to your health care professional about whether to or how to adjust your physical activity while you’re pregnant. If you have health issues such as obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, or anemia (too few healthy red blood cells), ask your health care professional about a level of activity that’s safe for you and your unborn baby.</item>
        <item>\t\t\tBreastfeeding may or may not make it easier for you to lose weight because your body uses extra calories to produce milk. Even if breastfeeding does not help you lose weight, it’s linked to many other benefits for mother and child.\n\n\t\t\tFor mothers who breastfeed, experts advise feeding their babies only breast milk for the first 6 months—no other foods or drinks during this time. Experts suggest that those women continue breastfeeding at least until their baby reaches 12 months.\n\n\t\t\tCalorie needs when you’re breastfeeding depend on how much body fat you have and how active you are. Talk with your health care professional about your calorie needs while you are breastfeeding.</item>

    <string name="week1_2">The journey begins with fertilization, where a sperm penetrates an egg, resulting in the formation of a zygote. This zygote, now a fertilized egg, embarks on its voyage towards the uterus.</string>
    <string name="week3_4">The developing embryo transitions into a blastocyst as it moves into the uterus. This marks the initiation of the formation of fundamental structures like the placenta. Early versions of vital organs, such as the heart, brain, eyes, and limb buds, start to take shape.</string>
    <string name="week5_8">A crescendo of development ensues as the heart begins to beat, and the embryo transforms into a recognizable fetus. Organogenesis is in full swing, laying the groundwork for future growth and specialization of various bodily systems.</string>
    <string name="week9_12">The fetus further solidifies its form during this period, with facial features becoming distinct, and tiny fingers and toes emerging. Major organ systems continue to evolve, and the nervous system undergoes critical early development.</string>
    <string name="week13_16">The fetus enters a phase of increased activity, and movements become perceptible to the mother. Meanwhile, the toes begin to form, and gender-specific characteristics become identifiable.</string>
    <string name="week17_20"> The second trimester witnesses a sensory blossoming, with the fetus developing the ability to hear. Fetal movements become more pronounced, and the mother may have the enchanting experience of listening to the rhythmic cadence of her baby\'s heartbeat.</string>
    <string name="week21_24"> Rapid growth is the hallmark of this stage, as the fetus\'s proportions become more defined. The respiratory system begins its maturation, although the lungs are not yet fully equipped for independent breathing.</string>
    <string name="week25_26">The fetus\'s eyes, closed until now, begin to open. Critical developments occur in the respiratory system, preparing it for the impending transition to life outside the womb. The fetus becomes responsive to external stimuli, such as touch and sound.</string>
    <string name="week27_30">A layer of fat accumulates beneath the fetus\'s skin, aiding in temperature regulation. Reflexes, such as swallowing and sucking, continue to refine.</string>
    <string name="week31_34">Most organs are on the brink of maturity, and the fetal position shifts, with the head typically pointing downward in preparation for birth. The respiratory system, a focal point of the third trimester, progresses towards full functionality.</string>
    <string name="week35_38">The final weeks see the completion of the digestive and respiratory systems. The fetus continues to gain weight, primarily in the form of crucial adipose tissue, ensuring readiness for the journey into the outside world.</string>
    <string name="week39_40">Culminating the intricate dance of development, the fetus is now poised for birth. Organ systems are mature, and the baby often descends into the pelvic region, signaling the imminent arrival.</string>

    <string name="armHelp">Measuring Arm Circumference with Precision</string>
    <string name="armHelpDesc">\t\t\tAccurately measuring arm circumference is a straightforward process using a flexible tape measure. Position the individual comfortably, locate the midpoint between shoulder and elbow, wrap the tape gently around the arm, and record the measurement. Consistency is crucial for reliable results, making it an essential step for tracking physical changes or ensuring accurate clothing adjustments.</string>
    <string name="fundusHelp">Fundus Height Measurement in Pregnancy</string>
    <string name="fundusHelpDesc">\t\t\tTo estimate the height of the uterus during pregnancy, fundus height measurement is a crucial prenatal practice. The individual should lie down or sit with a straight back, exposing the abdomen. Utilizing a flexible tape, start above the pelvic bone, extending it along the abdomen\'s curve to the top of the fundus uteri. Ensure the tape lies flat and is snug for an accurate reading. Consistent measurements aid in monitoring fetal growth, but professional evaluation is necessary for a comprehensive diagnosis. Always consult healthcare providers for result interpretation and guidance.</string>
    <string name="heartHelp">Measuring Heart Rate</string>
    <string name="heartHelpDesc">\t\t\tTo measure heart rate per minute, locate your pulse by placing your index and middle fingers on the side of your neck or wrist. Alternatively, position your fingertips on the inside of your wrist or at the base of your thumb. Count the number of heartbeats you feel for a full minute. If counting for a minute is challenging, count for 15 seconds and multiply the result by four to get the beats per minute. Alternatively, you can use electronic heart rate measurement devices like heart rate monitors or smartwatches for automatic readings. Ensure your body is in a relaxed state for accurate results, avoiding intense movements or conversation during the measurement. Record the heart rate per minute, reflecting how fast or slow your heart beats in one minute. This simple measurement provides insights into cardiovascular activity and overall heart health, with the normal adult heart rate typically ranging from 60 to 100 beats per minute. If you have concerns about your heart rate, it\'s advisable to consult with a healthcare professional.</string>
